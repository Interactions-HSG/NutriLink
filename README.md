# NutriLink Ontology

## Overview

NutriLink is an ontology that links digital receipts from loyalty cards
to comprehensive nutrition details of recorded products, and further to structured dietary recommendations. 

NutriLink was created following the [Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development](doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3189769), based on 3 key components: 
- digital receipts from loyalty cards; 
- food product nutrition information; 
- aggregation of information of products within a single basket. 

## Purpose

The purpose of the NutriLink Ontology is to:

- Permit evaluating food purchase quality at the basket level and across baskets
- Enable provisioning of structured dietary recommendations to users

## Integration with other established ontologies

The NutriLink ontology is linked to the following established food ontologies

- [FoodOn](https://github.com/FoodOntology/foodon)
- [GoodRelations](purl.org/goodrelations)
- [AGROVOC](https://agrovoc.fao.org/browse/agrovoc/en/)
- schema.org
    The integration of NutriLink with schema.org is done through integration with GoodRelations and FoodOn, which employ schema concepts.
